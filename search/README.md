This is a generic Java search library that can solve arbitrary search problems. The library also supports both Tree search and Graph search strategies as well as informed and uninformed search algorithms. I applied it to two concrete problems: the n-puzzle and the problem of finding a tour through all cities in Romania. List of available algorithms:
Uninformed Search Algorithms
􏰂 Depth-First Tree Search
􏰂 Breadth-First Tree Search
􏰂 Iterative-deepening Tree Search
􏰂 Depth-First Graph Search
􏰂 Breadth-First Graph Search
􏰂 Iterative-deepening Graph Search
Informed Search Algorithms
􏰂 Best-First Tree Search 􏰂 Best-First Graph Search
􏰂 A* Tree Search 􏰂 A* Graph Search
