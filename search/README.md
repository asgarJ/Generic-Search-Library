This is a generic Java search library that can solve arbitrary search problems. The library supports Tree and Graph search strategies as well as informed and uninformed search techniques. Below is the list of algorithms available in the library:

                Informed Search Algorithms

        A* Tree Search                  A* Graph Search
        Best-First Tree Search          Best-First Graph Search

                Uninformed Search Algorithms

        Depth-First Tree Search         Depth-First Graph Search
        Breadth-First Tree Search       Breadth-First Graph Search
        Iterative-deepening Tree Search and Graph Search
