This is a generic Java search library that can solve arbitrary search problems. The library also supports both Tree search and Graph search strategies as well as informed and uninformed search algorithms. Additionally, two implementations of the library on two concrete problems are available on other folders in this repo: the n-puzzle and the problem of finding a tour through all cities in Romania. Below are list of available algorithms in the library:
                    
                    Uninformed Search Algorithms
